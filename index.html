      <h2 class="heading1">What is JavaScript?</h2>
      <p class="notes1"> JavaScript was designed to add interactivity to HTML pages
       JavaScript is a scripting language
       A scripting language is a lightweight programming language
       JavaScript is usually embedded directly into HTML pages
       JavaScript is an interpreted language (means that scripts execute without preliminary compilation)
       Everyone can use JavaScript without purchasing a license
      Java and JavaScript are two completely different languages in both concept and design!
      Java (developed by Sun Microsystems) is a powerful and much more complex programming language - in
      the same category as C and C++.</p>

      <p class="notes2"> Numbers - are values that can be processed and calculated. You don't enclose them in quotation
      marks. The numbers can be either positive or negative.
       Strings - are a series of letters and numbers enclosed in quotation marks. JavaScript uses the string
      literally; it doesn't process it. You'll use strings for text you want displayed or values you want
      passed along.
       Boolean (true/false) - lets you evaluate whether a condition meets or does not meet specified
      criteria.
       Null - is an empty value. null is not the same as 0 -- 0 is a real, calculable number, whereas null is
      the absence of any value.

      <h1 class="heading3">JavaScript Functions</h1>
      <p class="notes3">A function (also known as a method) is a self-contained piece of code that performs a particular
"function". You can recognise a function by its format - it's a piece of descriptive text, followed by open
and close brackets.A function is a reusable code-block that will be executed by an event, or when the
function is called.
To keep the browser from executing a script when the page loads, you can put your script into a function.
A function contains code that will be executed by an event or by a call to that function.
You may call a function from anywhere within the page (or even from other pages if the function is
embedded in an external .js file).
Functions can be defined both in the <head> and in the <body> section of a document. However, to
assure that the function is read/loaded by the browser before it is called, it could be wise to put it in the
<head> section.</p>
